# Generating Azure CLI Commands

## Prerequisites

- Python SDK is already generated
- Integration Tests for Python SDK are generated and validated
- Minimal **readme.cli.md** file is already in place

## Manual Generation

### Prepare Your Environment

The best way of using **autorest.cli** is Docker container.

You need to clone following directories locally. I have added Python SDK here as well, it's not necessary, but may be useful.

    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli-extensions.git
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python.git
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/autorest.cli.git

For simplicity let's assume they are cloned under **c:\dev** directory on Windows machine.

The easiest way to use **autorest.cli** is the container:

    docker run -it --rm -v c:\dev:/_ mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli/tools

>NOTE: In final solution it won't be necessary to clone Autorest CLI repository

### Generate Extension

Following command will generate default Azure CLI extension considering all ther prerequisites are in place

    autorest --cli --use=/_/autorest.cli --cli-module --extension --output-folder=/_/azure-cli-extensions /_/azure-rest-api-specs/specification/frontdoor/resource-manager/readme.md


## Next Steps

### Changing Extension / Top Command Group Name

If extension name generated by default is not desired, just add following line to **readme.cli.md**:

  cli:
    ...
    group-name: my-extension-name
    ...

### Fixing Example Description / Name

Initially example names won't look very good, just like below **ManagedNetworksPut** is not a very good name/description:

    Examples
        ManagedNetworksPut
            az managednetwork create --resource-group "myResourceGroup" --name "myManagedNetwork" \
            --location "eastus"

In order to change this name, find name location in swagger specification:

        "x-ms-examples": {
          "ManagedNetworksPut": {
            "$ref": "./examples/ManagedNetwork/ManagedNetworksPut.json"
          }
        }

and change it to be more descriptive:

        "x-ms-examples": {
          "Create Managed Network": {
            "$ref": "./examples/ManagedNetwork/ManagedNetworksPut.json"
          }
        }
